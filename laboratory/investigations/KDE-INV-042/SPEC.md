# Investigation: KDE-INV-042

**ID**: KDE-INV-042
**Title**: Bootstrap Compliance Investigation
**Date**: 2026-07-24T07:37:38Z
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Author**: KDE Runtime Investigation
**Investigation Type**: Runtime Governance

---

## Precondition Verification

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| KDE Bootstrap | ✅ VERIFIED | .kde/bootstrap/config.yaml v1.0.0 |
| Repository Scope | ✅ VERIFIED | Trexa repository |
| Authorization | ✅ VERIFIED | Per KDE-INV-042 mandate |

---

## Authorization

This investigation is conducted per the KDE-INV-042 mandate to determine whether Bootstrap alone is sufficient to prevent unauthorized implementation behavior by implementation actors.

---

## Background

KDE assumes that every implementation actor begins by initializing the repository runtime through the Bootstrap process. Bootstrap establishes the active engineering context by loading:

- Runtime
- Repository knowledge
- Governance rules
- Current implementation state
- Active implementation specification

Recent implementation observations suggest that an implementation actor may revert to its own prior knowledge when Bootstrap is incomplete, skipped, or ineffective.

This investigation seeks to determine whether Bootstrap alone is sufficient to prevent unauthorized implementation behavior.

---

## Objective

Determine how KDE can ensure that every implementation actor is operating under the repository runtime rather than relying on its own prior knowledge.

The investigation shall remain implementation-actor independent.

---

# Executive Summary

**Core Finding**: Bootstrap alone is **NOT sufficient** to ensure runtime compliance. A multi-layered Bootstrap Compliance Model is required.

## Key Conclusions

| Finding | Confidence | Evidence |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Bootstrap is necessary but insufficient | HIGH | Cannot verify actor state post-initialization |
| Runtime drift is possible | HIGH | No continuous validation mechanism |
| Self-detection of prior knowledge is unreliable | HIGH | Actor cannot distinguish its own knowledge from runtime knowledge |
| Fail-closed policy is recommended | HIGH | Unauthorized implementation causes greater harm than blocked implementation |
| Continuous validation is required | HIGH | One-time initialization cannot guarantee ongoing compliance |

## Recommended Model Components

1. **Bootstrap Lifecycle** — Definitive initialization sequence
2. **Bootstrap Compliance Model** — Continuous monitoring framework
3. **Failure Taxonomy** — Structured failure classification
4. **Runtime Validation Strategy** — Ongoing compliance verification
5. **Governance Recommendations** — Policy directives
6. **Runtime Patch** — Bootstrap verification module

# 4. Prior Knowledge Detection Mechanisms (Q4)

## 4.1 Self-Detection Feasibility

**Can an implementation actor detect that it is operating from prior knowledge instead of repository knowledge?**

### 4.1.1 Theoretical Analysis

| Detection Method | Feasibility | Reliability |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Internal state inspection | ❌ NOT FEASIBLE | N/A |
| Memory comparison | ❌ NOT FEASIBLE | N/A |
| Source attribution | ⚠️ UNRELIABLE | LOW |
| Output validation | ✅ POSSIBLE | MEDIUM |

### 4.1.2 Why Self-Detection Fails

1. **Inability to distinguish knowledge sources**: An actor cannot determine whether a response originates from its training data or loaded knowledge
2. **No introspection mechanism**: Standard AI implementations lack the ability to trace knowledge provenance
3. **Knowledge conflation**: Prior and repository knowledge may be semantically merged
4. **No self-audit capability**: Actors cannot verify their own compliance

## 4.2 External Detection Mechanisms

Since self-detection is unreliable, external validation is required:

### 4.2.1 Artifact-Based Detection

| Method | Mechanism | Detection Capability |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Naming audit | Check artifact prefixes | BEHAVIOR-001 |
| Evidence audit | Verify investigation references | BEHAVIOR-004 |
| Timeline audit | Verify timestamp sequences | DRIFT-002 |
| Scope audit | Compare against IMP | BEHAVIOR-005 |

### 4.2.2 Behavioral-Based Detection

| Method | Mechanism | Detection Capability |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Decision audit | Trace decision rationale | BEHAVIOR-003 |
| Compliance check | Verify governance adherence | BEHAVIOR-001 |
| Knowledge probe | Test repository knowledge application | BEHAVIOR-006 |

### 4.2.3 Runtime-Based Detection

| Method | Mechanism | Detection Capability |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| State verification | Confirm runtime state | INCOMPLETE-004 |
| Module health check | Verify all modules | INCOMPLETE-003 |
| Event verification | Confirm event logging | INCOMPLETE-005 |

## 4.3 Recommended Detection Strategy

| Layer | Method | Frequency |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Pre-implementation | Bootstrap verification | Every session |
| During implementation | Artifact monitoring | Continuous |
| Post-implementation | Compliance audit | Per artifact |
| Periodic | Full state verification | Scheduled |

---

# 5. Implementation Blocking Policy (Q5)

## 5.1 Policy Options

### 5.1.1 Fail-Closed (Implementation Denied)

**Description**: Block implementation when Bootstrap cannot be verified.

| Advantages | Risks |
|------------|-------|
| Maximum safety | May block legitimate work |
| Clear boundary | Requires recovery procedure |
| Prevents drift | May frustrate actors |

### 5.1.2 Fail-Open (Implementation Proceeds)

**Description**: Allow implementation when Bootstrap verification fails.

| Advantages | Risks |
|------------|-------|
| Maximum throughput | May allow unauthorized work |
| No friction | Governance bypass |
| Actor autonomy | Knowledge provenance unclear |

### 5.1.3 Safe Mode (Clarification Required)

**Description**: Pause implementation and request human clarification.

| Advantages | Risks |
|------------|-------|
| Human oversight | Requires human availability |
| Clear escalation | May delay work |
| Shared responsibility | Unclear ownership |

## 5.2 Comparative Analysis

| Criterion | Fail-Closed | Fail-Open | Safe Mode |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Safety | HIGH | LOW | MEDIUM |
| Throughput | LOW | HIGH | MEDIUM |
| Governance | STRONG | WEAK | STRONG |
| Recovery | CLEAR | UNCLEAR | CLEAR |
| Human burden | LOW | LOW | HIGH |

## 5.3 Recommendation

**Recommended Policy**: Hybrid Fail-Closed with Safe Mode escalation

| Condition | Policy |
|-----------|--------|
| Bootstrap unverified | **FAIL-CLOSED**: Block implementation |
| Bootstrap partial | **SAFE MODE**: Request human clarification |
| Bootstrap verified but drift suspected | **MONITOR**: Enhanced validation |
| Emergency override | **HUMAN AUTHORIZATION**: Explicit approval required |

**Rationale**: The cost of unauthorized implementation exceeds the cost of blocked implementation. Safe Mode provides a recovery path while maintaining governance integrity.

# 6. Continuous Validation vs. Initialization (Q6)

## 6.1 Runtime Drift Analysis

**Can runtime drift occur after successful initialization?**

### 6.1.1 Drift Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description | Likelihood |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Context switching | Actor switches between contexts | HIGH |
| Memory decay | Runtime knowledge forgotten | MEDIUM |
| Knowledge conflict | Prior knowledge conflicts with runtime | HIGH |
| State corruption | Runtime state modified externally | LOW |
| Session reset | Actor session restarts | MEDIUM |

### 6.1.2 Drift Evidence

| Evidence | Indicates |
|----------|----------|
| Inconsistent artifact naming | Context loss |
| Missing IMP references | Knowledge decay |
| Timeline gaps | Session discontinuity |
| Untraced decisions | Rule abandonment |

## 6.2 Validation Strategies

### 6.2.1 Point-in-Time Validation

Performed at initialization only:

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Simple | Cannot detect drift |
| Low overhead | False confidence |
| Clear boundary | One-time only |

### 6.2.2 Continuous Validation

Performed throughout implementation:

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Detects drift | Higher overhead |
| Real-time compliance | Complex implementation |
| Adaptive | May slow work |

### 6.2.3 Periodic Validation

Performed at regular intervals:

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Balanced approach | Drift window |
| Predictable overhead | May miss violations |
| Configurable | Timing dependent |

## 6.3 Recommendation

**Recommended**: Periodic validation with continuous monitoring

| Phase | Validation Type | Frequency |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Session start | Full Bootstrap verification | Per session |
| During implementation | Lightweight monitoring | Continuous |
| Per artifact | Compliance audit | Per artifact |
| Daily | Full state verification | Per day |
| Session end | State checkpoint | Per session |

|---------|----------|------------|
| Bootstrap is necessary but insufficient | No continuous validation mechanism | HIGH |
| Self-detection of prior knowledge is unreliable | Actor introspection not available | HIGH |
| Runtime drift is possible | No drift detection implemented | HIGH |

## Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Priority |
|---|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Implement Bootstrap verification module | HIGH |
| 2 | Adopt fail-closed policy for unverified Bootstrap | HIGH |
| 3 | Establish continuous compliance monitoring | HIGH |
| 4 | Define human intervention protocols | HIGH |

---

# Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|

| Human availability | MEDIUM | HIGH | Define clear protocols |
| Recovery complexity | LOW | MEDIUM | Document procedures |

---

# Conclusion

Bootstrap is a necessary but insufficient condition for ensuring that implementation actors operate under repository governance. The investigation establishes that:

1. **Bootstrap establishes the foundation** — Initialization provides the necessary runtime context, knowledge, and governance rules.

2. **Continuous validation is required** — One-time Bootstrap cannot guarantee ongoing compliance due to runtime drift mechanisms.

3. **Self-detection is unreliable** — Implementation actors cannot reliably distinguish their own knowledge from repository knowledge.

4. **Fail-closed policy is recommended** — The cost of unauthorized implementation exceeds the cost of blocked implementation.

5. **Human intervention is essential** — Recovery procedures and critical decisions require human authorization.

The Bootstrap Compliance Model provides a framework for addressing these findings through checkpoints, validation, failure handling, and human intervention points.
