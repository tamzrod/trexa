## Precondition Verification

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| KDE Bootstrap | ✅ VERIFIED | .kde/bootstrap/config.yaml v1.0.0 |
| Repository Scope | ✅ VERIFIED | Trexa repository |
| Authorization | ✅ VERIFIED | Per KDE-INV-043 mandate |

---

## Authorization

This investigation is conducted per the KDE-INV-043 mandate to determine whether investigations should become the primary engineering workspace, with implementation restricted to assembling approved engineering knowledge.

---

## Background

### Current KDE Process

The current KDE process follows:

```
Investigation
→ Implementation Proposal
→ Human Approval
→ Implementation
```

### Problem Statement

Recent investigations suggest that implementation actors continue making engineering decisions after approval. This creates risk of:

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Governance bypass | Decisions made outside approved scope |
| Knowledge drift | Unapproved engineering choices |
| Traceability loss | Untracked decision rationale |
| Quality variance | Inconsistent engineering standards |

### Proposed Methodology

A new methodology has been proposed:

> Instead of allowing engineering decisions during implementation:
> - Engineering is completed entirely inside investigations
> - Investigations may continue through multiple iterations
> - Investigations may contain architecture, code prototypes, schemas, algorithms, interfaces, and engineering decisions
> - Only approved engineering knowledge may leave an investigation
> - Implementation performs assembly only

---

## Objective

Determine whether investigations should become the primary engineering workspace, with implementation restricted to assembling previously approved engineering knowledge.

# Executive Summary

**Core Finding**: The proposed methodology is **RECOMMENDED FOR ADOPTION** with modifications.

## Key Conclusions

| Finding | Confidence | Impact |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Investigations should expand scope | HIGH | HIGH |
| Implementation should restrict to assembly | HIGH | HIGH |
| Knowledge promotion model is feasible | HIGH | MEDIUM |
| Actor qualification is required | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| New lifecycle is required | HIGH | HIGH |

## Recommended Changes

1. **Expand Investigation Scope** — Include architecture, prototypes, schemas, algorithms
2. **Introduce Knowledge Promotion** — Formal process for releasing approved knowledge
3. **Restrict Implementation** — Assembly, wiring, organization only
4. **Require Actor Qualification** — Demonstrate understanding before implementation
5. **Implement New Lifecycle** — Investigation → Promotion → Implementation
