**ID**: KDE-INV-044
**Title**: Engineering Decision Classification Investigation
**Date**: 2026-07-24T08:05:00Z
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Author**: KDE Runtime Investigation
**Investigation Type**: Governance Framework

## Precondition Verification

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| KDE Bootstrap | ✅ VERIFIED | .kde/bootstrap/config.yaml v1.0.0 |
| Repository Scope | ✅ VERIFIED | Trexa repository |
| Authorization | ✅ VERIFIED | Per KDE-INV-044 mandate |

---

## Authorization

This investigation is conducted per the KDE-INV-044 mandate to establish a formal decision classification model for KDE, enabling consistent identification of engineering decisions vs implementation activities.

---

## Background

KDE-INV-043 established that implementation shall not perform engineering decisions. However, the term "Engineering Decision" has not been formally defined.

---

# Executive Summary

**Core Finding**: Engineering decisions are choices that **constrain** future options, create **commitments**, or establish **patterns**. This investigation provides a formal definition, classification framework, and governance model.

---

# 1. Engineering Decision Definition (Q1)

## 1.1 Formal Definition

> **Engineering Decision**: A choice that constrains future options, creates commitments, or establishes patterns for the system.

## 1.2 Decision Identification Test

```
Q1: Does this CHOOSE among alternatives?
    └─ If NO → Not a decision

Q2: Does this CONSTRAINT future choices?
    ├─ If YES → ENGINEERING DECISION
    └─ If NO → Continue to Q3

Q3: Does this COMMIT to a pattern or approach?
    ├─ If YES → ENGINEERING DECISION
    └─ If NO → Implementation
```

# 2. Decision Categories (Q2)

## 2.1 Category Taxonomy

| Category | Level | Definition |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **STRATEGIC** | 1 | Platform and technology choices |
| **ARCHITECTURAL** | 2 | System structure and components |
| **DESIGN** | 3 | API contracts and interfaces |
| **ENGINEERING** | 4 | Implementation approaches |
| **STRUCTURAL** | 5 | File organization |
| **Configuration** | — | System parameter decisions |
| **Testing** | — | Verification approach |
| **Documentation** | — | Knowledge capture |
| **Tooling** | — | Development tools |
| **Runtime** | — | Runtime behavior |

---

# 3. Investigation Approval Requirements (Q3)

## 3.1 Authority by Category

| Category | Investigation Required | Implementation Allowed | Runtime/Standard Allowed |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **STRATEGIC** | ✅ (TDR) | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **ARCHITECTURAL** | ✅ Required | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **DESIGN** | ✅ Required | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **ENGINEERING** | ⚠️ Conditional | ⚠️ Conditional | ⚠️ Conditional |
| **STRUCTURAL** | ❌ No | ⚠️ Conditional | ✅ Yes |
| **Testing** | ⚠️ Conditional | ⚠️ Conditional | ✅ Yes |

# 4. Decision Levels (Q4)

## 4.1 Impact Levels

| Level | Name | Impact Scope | Reversibility |
|-------|------|--------------|---------------|
| **1** | Strategic | Entire system | Irreversible |
| **2** | Architectural | Multiple components | Very difficult |
| **3** | Design | Component interfaces | Difficult |
| **4** | Engineering | Single component | Moderate |
| **5** | Structural | Files/directories | Easy |
| **6** | Mechanical | Code within file | Very easy |

---

# 5. Undefined Decision Response (Q5)

## 5.1 Response Protocol

| Option | Condition | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Follow Standard** | Covered by standard | Apply standard |
| **Defer** | Can wait | Skip and continue |
| **Stop** | Blocking, no authority | FAIL-CLOSED |
| **Request Clarification** | Non-blocking | Open ticket |

---

# 6. Authority Delegation (Q6)

## 6.1 Delegation Boundaries

| Cannot Delegate | Limited Delegation | Broad Delegation |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| STRATEGIC | DESIGN | STRUCTURAL |
| ARCHITECTURAL | ENGINEERING | Testing |
| — | Tooling | Documentation |

---

# 7. Decision Classification Framework (Q7)

## 7.1 Framework Components

1. **Identification** — Decision vs Implementation Test
2. **Categorization** — Category and Level Assignment
3. **Governance** — Authority Matrix
4. **Validation** — Pre/Post Decision Checks

## 7.2 Authority Hierarchy

# Conclusion

This investigation establishes a complete Decision Classification Framework for KDE:

1. **Formal Definition**: Engineering Decisions are choices that constrain, commit, or establish patterns.
2. **Taxonomy**: 10 categories spanning STRATEGIC to RUNTIME, with 6 impact levels.
3. **Authority Matrix**: Clear authority sources for each category.
4. **Governance Model**: Requirements for each category with escalation protocols.
