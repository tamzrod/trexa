## Core Principles

Trexa follows these engineering principles, derived from the AI-First methodology and evidence-based development practices.

### 1. Evidence Over Intuition

All decisions must be grounded in verifiable evidence.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Decision evidence | Every decision requires supporting evidence |
| Investigation records | All significant work documented in `laboratory/investigations/` |
| Traceability | Conclusions trace to their evidence |

### 2. Experiment Before Deployment

Validate knowledge before operational use.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Hypothesis testing | Experiments before implementation |
| Validation | Results validated before use |
| Reproducibility | Experiments must be reproducible |

### 3. Preserve Ambiguity

Do not prematurely resolve uncertainty.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Timing | Resolve ambiguity when evidence is sufficient |
| Documentation | Document open questions in investigations |
| Iteration | Allow ideas to evolve with evidence |

### 4. Traceability Always

Every conclusion must trace to evidence.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Link evidence | Conclusions reference supporting evidence |
| Chain integrity | No orphaned conclusions |
| Audit trail | Full decision history preserved |

### 5. Reproducibility Required

All experiments must be reproducible.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Methodology | Experiments documented with clear methodology |
| Results | Raw results preserved in `laboratory/evidence/` |
| Verification | Results verifiable by others |

## AI-First Principles

### 6. AI as Primary Developer

AI agents handle most implementation.

| Implication | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Code quality | AI-generated code meets standards |
| Review process | Human review of AI output |
| Tooling | Support Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code |

### 7. Human as Approver

Humans review and authorize decisions.

| Implication | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Final authority | Humans approve significant changes |
| Oversight | Human review of AI decisions |
| Authorization | Explicit human authorization required |

### 8. Structured Workflow

Investigations, decisions, implementations follow defined process.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Investigation | Research and analysis |
| Decision | Evidence-based choice |
| Implementation | Code and documentation |

## Documentation Principles

### 9. Single Source of Truth

Each piece of knowledge exists in exactly one authoritative location.

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Methodology | `laboratory/methodology/` |
| Decisions | `laboratory/decisions/` |
| Product docs | `docs/application/` |

### 10. Consumer-Focused Documentation

Write for the intended audience.

| Audience | Documentation |
|----------|--------------|
| Users | `docs/application/` |
| Developers | `docs/application/` + `laboratory/` |
| Engineers | `laboratory/` + `docs/kde/` |
